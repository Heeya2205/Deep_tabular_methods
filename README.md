# Deep_tabular_methods
This repository contains the implementation of the paper titled "Non-Contact Stress Assessment Based on Deep Tabular Method." The paper presents a non-invasive approach for classifying stress tasks (binary and ternary) and stress levels. The model leverages remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals extracted from facial videos to classify both stress tasks and stress levels.

Abstract
Stress is a significant factor impacting human health, potentially leading to serious conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and anxiety. This work proposes a non-contact method for stress detection based on rPPG signals and a tabular deep learning architecture. The method has been validated on the publicly available UBFC-Phys dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results for binary and multi-level stress classification tasks.
